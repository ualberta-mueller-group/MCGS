(AccessModifierOffset: -2 --> -4) #3
"public", "private", "protected" not indented from brace level

(AlignAfterOpenBracket: Align --> DontAlign) #4

(AllowShortFunctionsOnASingleLine: None --> Empty) #74
Empty functions have braces on the same line i.e.:
    cli_options::~cli_options() {}

(BraceWrapping.AfterCaseLabel: false --> true) #86
Brace on own line for case statement

(BraceWrapping.BeforeLambdaBody: false --> true) #98
Brace on own line for lambda function

(BreakTemplateDeclarations: MultiLine --> Yes) #118
"template <class T>" on its own line

(EmptyLineBeforeAccessModifier: LogicalBlock --> Always) #128
For access modifiers (i.e. "public" etc) other than the first, an empty line is
included before. "LogicalBlock" is insufficient as it treats comments as empty lines

(IndentCaseLabels: false --> true) #155
Case label indented inside of switch braces

(PointerAlignment: Right --> Left) #202
Pointers on left side

(SortIncludes: CaseSensitive --> false) #215
Don't change "#include" ordering

(SpaceAfterCStyleCast: false --> true) #218
i.e. "(float) 4" instead of "(float)4"

(SeparateDefinitionBlocks: Leave --> Always) #212
Empty lines between definitions for classes, structs, enums, and functions

    DON'T KEEP:
    (SpaceAroundPointerQualifiers: Default --> Both) #221
