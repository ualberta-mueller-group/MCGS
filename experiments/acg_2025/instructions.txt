==================== Files in This Directory ====================
- experiments.test2
    Input data of experiments used in ACG 2025 paper.
- experiment_results.tar
    Archive of output data of experiments used in ACG 2025 paper.
- experiments.sh
    Bash script to run the ACG 2025 paper experiments. Uses experiments.test2,
    runtests.py, and diagram.py files included in this directory. You can edit
    experiments.sh if you want to generate a new experiments.test2 input file.
- runtests.py
    Test runner which uses multiple MCGS processes in parallel to run test
    cases for all ablation levels. Output is experiment_results directory.
    Pre-configured the same way as run for the ACG 2025 paper, but note that
    this will use lots of memory and CPU threads. See configuration under
    "Edit these" comment at the top.
- diagram.py
    Uses experiment_results output directory to create diagram images for
    the experiments. Uses the Python libraries "matplotlib" and "numpy".

==================== Running the Experiments ====================
Copy the contents of this directory into the project's root directory after
checking out commit hash 4113a903b24744b901173e5d18f06484887415ba, replacing
that commit's versions of these files with those from this directory.

Edit the options near the top of runtests.py if necessary, then run
experiments.sh.

First, this will delete database.bin and any diagrams/output data from previous
runs. database.bin will be rebuilt using MCGS. The ".test2" file is like a
".test" file but each test case is on its own line. Metadata is encoded into
comments of each test case.

Next, the tests will be run with runtests.py, and this will generate
many csv files (creating the experiment_results directory).

Lastly, diagram.py will be used to read the csvs, and create/save diagrams as
images (creating the diagrams directory).

==================== Other Information ====================
src/gen_experiments.cpp is the code that generates the input data file
(experiments.test2). The included input file was generated using the
aforementioned commit, though note that its exact contents are
machine/compiler-dependent.
