{version 1.2}
/* This is a comment */

/*_ This file is valid input to MCGS, and describes the input syntax. You can
run it with:
    ./MCGS --file <path to this file>

There are 5 types of 'things' that appear in input: 
   Comments
        Enclosed by '/*' and '*/', text inside a comment is used by humans
        reading input files, and may be included in output from MCGS's testing
        framework. More on this later.

    Section titles
        Enclosed by '[' and ']', text inside a section title defines what type
        of game to interpret subsequent text as. Sections persist until
        a new section title is encountered.

        i.e. '[clobber_1xn]'
        Additionally, you can create impartial versions of games like so:
        '[impartial clobber_1xn]'
        Creating an impartial version of an already impartial game has no
        effect. i.e.
        '[impartial kayles]' is effectively the same as '[kayles]'
 
    Commands
        Enclosed by '{' and '}', commands are used to solve sums of games for 
        one or more players, optionally defining an expected result
        (win/loss/nim value). Commands are also used to specify what version of
        the input language is used by a file. The version command must be
        present in files, but can be omitted from input read from stdin or
        passed as a command line argument to MCGS. The current version is 1.2.
            i.e.
            Version command:
                {version 1.2}

            Solve the current game sum for black, without expecting a particular
            result:
                {B}
            Solve the current game sum for black, and then white, expecting
            white to win.
                {B, W win}
            Solve the current game sum for white, then black, expecting
            white to lose and black to win.
                {W loss, B win}
            Solve the current game, getting its nim value. Only legal if sum
            contains no partizan games.
                {N}
            Same as above, but expect nim value of 5.
                {N 5}
            You can mix N with B and W, so long as N is legal:
            {B win, N 2, W win}

            'Solve' commands can solve a game sum up to 3 times, i.e.
            {B, W, B, N} is illegal

    Bracketed games
        Enclosed by '(' and ')', text inside a bracketed game defines a single
        game within the current section. The type of game depends on the
        section.

        i.e. 
        A single game 'XOXOXO':
            (XOXOXO)
        A single game '1 2':
            (1 2)

    Unbracketed games
        Whitespace-separated text not matched by the aforementioned cases
        defines a single game within the current section. The type of game
        depends on the section.

        i.e.
        define two games, 'XO.X' and 'XO':
            XO.X XO
        define one game, '5':
            5


    The following example solves a sum of
        2 clobber_1xn games
        2 integer_game games
        2 more clobber_1xn games
        1 dyadic_rational game
        3 switch_game games
    Twice: once for black, then white. Then it solves an 
    empty sum for black, expecting a loss.

    Then solves a sum of:
        1 kayles game
        1 impartial clobber_1xn game
    For black, and then gets its nim value.

        Game syntax
    This section defines the syntax for each game supported by MCGS.

    Definitions:
        'int':
            A sequence of 1 or more numeric digits, possibly 
            preceded by a '-'. No spaces allowed.

        'fraction':
            Either an int, or two ints separated by a '/'. Denominator
            must be a positive power of 2. Spaces between each component
            are allowed, and optional. i.e:
                '1/4'
                '1'
                '-3 / 8'

        'star':
            The character '*'.

        'list':
            A sequence of 1 or more items. Items can be separated by
            commas and/or spaces. Commas are not allowed at the
            end of the list. The following are all equivalent:
                '1, -1/2, 3, 4'
                '1,-1/2,3,4'
                '1 -1/2 3 4'
                '  1  -1  /  2   3  ,  4  '

    Games:
        [clobber_1xn], [nogo_1xn], and [elephants]:
            Contiguous sequence of '.', 'X', and 'O'.
        
        [nogo], and [clobber]
            Contiguous sequence of '.', 'X', 'O', and '|'. A flattened row-major
            representation of 2D board with '|' separating the rows.

        [integer_game], [nimber], and [kayles]:
            A single int.

        [dyadic_rational]:
            A single fraction. i.e. '1/4', '-3 / 8', '-3'

        [switch_game]:
            A list of 2 fractions.

        [up_star]:
            A non-empty list of at most one star, and at most one int.

        [impartial <GAME_NAME>]
            An impartial version of a game with name <GAME_NAME>. Accepts same
            input as partizan version.
*/

/*_
        More on syntax:

    Comments by default belong to all '(sum, player)' pairs solved by the next
    'solve' command. These will be included in output from
    MCGS's testing framework.

    If a comment starts with '_', it will not be included in output.

    If a comment starts with '#0', '#1', or '#2', it will only be included in 
    output for the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd '(sum, player)' pair corresponding to the
    next 'solve' command.


    Enclosing symbols i.e. '[', ']', '(', ')', etc must have at least one
    whitespace character before (or after) them. The following is illegal:
        [integer_game]3
    or
        3(4)


    Names of sections, i.e. [clobber_1xn] are defined by the
    add_game_parser() function of the file_parser class in file_parser.h
    After registering your game, its impartial variant will automatically exist,
    i.e. [impartial YOUR_GAME_NAME]
