Check out commit hash 4113a903b24744b901173e5d18f06484887415ba instead.
The contents of this directory should already be at the root of the project,
though with less documentation.

Edit the options near the top of runtests.py (using the commit hash above,
these should already be configured for running on fire-point), then run
experiments.sh.

This will delete database.bin and any diagrams/data from previous runs.
database.bin and the experiment test case file ("experiments.test2") will be
rebuilt using MCGS. The .test2 file is like a .test file but each test case is
on its own line. Metadata is encoded into comments of each test case.

Next, the tests will be run with runtests.py, and this will generate
many csv files.

Lastly, diagram.py will read the csvs, and create/save diagrams.
