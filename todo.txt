DONE
in game:
add to move stack
change toplay
everyone must call game::play()


TODO
move_generator* clobber_1xn

clobber board conversion char x,o,. vs board as EMPTY, BLACK, WHITE
write clobber board

use a proper unit test framework, maybe https://github.com/siu/minunit
add nim formula
add random testing for nim, in general? size parameter for random games?
game.generate_random(size)?

nim move generator could go into cpp. Only needed by nim_test - it could just use the generic movegenerator interface?

TALK
cgt solver talk
check old talk from BIRS
intro - math cgt vs cs cgt:
    math: prove theorems about class of games
    cs: efficiently compute result for a specific game
    cs for math: explore, try to find patterns, verify conjectures
    math for cs: improve efficiency of computation, simplify, shortcuts
goals of solver:
    general, efficient
    avoid canonical form
    use sum game structure
